    <h3>"Eating Ibotta's Good Food"</h3>
    <h4>10/8/2017</h4>
    <p>
      <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
      <p>I went to the PostgreSQL deep dive meetup hosted by "Full Stack" at the Ibotta offices on 11/8/2017</p>
      <h4>People I Met</h4>
      <p>Here's who I met. "Josh Greiner" A Turing School student who is about 6 weeks away from graduating. It was very valuable
      getting to hear what the curriculum was like, what he was learning, and how his job search was going. The biggest take away was that that the Turing program seems a little more "rigid" and that being proactive is key to eventually landing a job.
      The second person I met was a G55 student named "Jae Holderby". but I know he went to Univ. Colorado @ Boulder, and that his captstone project was related to food. It was great getting to see what life was like at the end of the program, as well
      as seeing how the G70 curriculum differs from the older Galvanize curriculum. He also answered all of my questions about what to expect later in the course and how to navigate the complex Denver job market. I also introduced myself to one of the
      hosts but I didn't want to talk to him very much because I frankly had no idea what Postgres was and I really just wanted to eat their food and try to learn something from the speakers.</p>
      <h4>What I Learned</h4>
      <p>First and foremost I learned that Postgres is currently beyond the realm of things that I'm ready to dive into. According to my own independent research, Postgres is "an object relational database management system with an emphasis on exstensibility and compliance." Considering the fact that
      I don't even really know what a database is, I certainly don't know what's necesary to manage one. I did however manage to take away a few key points about Postgres though. Version 10 just came out, and apparently version 10 is considerably less
      shitty than previous versions. Specifically, partitioning has been greatly improved in version 10. I can't wait to eventual partition something in Postgres, but I don't know if that day will ever actually come becuase I currently can't even make
      a useful for-loop without constant adult supervision. I also learned that Full Stack seems like a very good meetup organization. Though I only talked to 2 people, everyone seemed to be enjoying themself in a diverse and culturally-enriching environment.
      Maybe when I feel like I have something meaningful to contribute to a conversation about programming I will attempt to talk with more people (especially non-students), but in the meantime I will continue to just eat the food provided and stare awkwardly
      at the profressional developers that seem to be talking about important tech related topics. Perhaps, in one possible future, there will even be meetups where the topic is something I already know things about. I will keep my eyes open for these
      types of meetups.</p>
      <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
      <p>Should I keep attending meetups that are way over my head? How do you talk to people at meetups without sounding like a fucking idiot? Is it bad form to ask "what is PostgreSQL?" at an event titled "PostgreSQL
      Deep Dive"? How does PostgreSQL differ from other software that does the same thing? Will anyone ever pay me actual money to be a programmer?</p>
    <h3>"Hating Life at the Library"</h3>
    <h4>11/7/2017</h4>
    <p>
      <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
      <p>Learn Python (pt 1) Hosted by the Denver Public Library at 6pm on 11/7/2017</p>
      <h4>People I Met</h4>
      <p>I met a student who attends Metro State University who has a background in Javascript and wants to learn Python to bolster her skillset. I
      also met a guy that has worked in I.T. for a decade but has never written a line of code before. This is really not a good networking meetup. Most people are very antisocial, generally pissed off that they're at the library, or literally speaking
      Chinese to other Chinese people. The lack of beer and pizza doesn't foster an atmosphere of comraderie, friendship, and teamwork. Instead it fosters an atmosphere of anger, hostility, and yearning for libations. There was also no time to "mingle"
      before or after the event.</p>
      <h4>What I Learned</h4>
      <p>I learned 2 things. The first takeaway I got was that the Denver Public Library is not a very nice place to spend time. Unbeknownst to me at the time, it turns out that DPL is literally a homesless shelter
      as well as a place to go read books. I think this is very progressive of the librrary, but in all honesty it makes the library a less desirable place to be, especially if you're not homesless. It also makes it so that you can't have beer and pizza
      like a proper tech meetup should. The second thing I learned was that Python is basically just Javascript for peasants that are too stupid to use semicolons. at least at the introductory level, most of the syntax was almost identical to Javascript,
      but without the prestige/decorum of Javascript's eloquent punctuation. We did fascinating things with Python like basic arithmetic and console logging "Hello World." Going forward, I wonder if it makes a lot of sense to program in python alongside
      JS because they're so similar, or if the slight nuances would make it difficult to jump back and forth between Python and JS without making a lot of small mistakes.</p>
      <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
      <p>What is the point of using Python instead of JS? Is one better
      than the other for certain applications? Where can I learn more Python other than the Public Library? (I hate the library and don't want to go back) Is it confusing to jump between Python and JS? How can I make more friends at meetups even if the
      meetup sucks? How can I be sure there will be pizza at a meetup before I go there and starve? Does my computer have a disease from using the insecure wifi at DPL?</p>
