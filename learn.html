      <h3>"Learning HTML"</h3>
      <h4>10/28/2017</h4>
      <p>Yesterday, I began making my way through the HTML exercises in
      our curriculum. First, I set the stage by clearing any distractions.
      All I needed was my text editor (Atom) and a window of Chrome to
      view the changes I was making in the browser (see image). Then, it
      was time to "play". This wasn't nearly as intimidating as learning
      Git in the terminal because you can see everything as it's happening
      and make adjustments accordingly. In other words, HTML seemed a little
      more static whereas Git had a lot more dynamic moving parts. Also,
      with HTML, there seemed to be a lot more creativity/ room for
      experimenting, whereas Git was a much more procedural/rigid concept.
      Realistically, setting the stage is a great way to start off without
      any distractions, and it definitely helped in the beginning. However,
      since I'm working on a computer, distractions are still just a click
      away. Going forward, I think I could build on "setting the stage" by
      using my chrome settings to block distracting websites for a set time,
      putting my phone on silent and putting it out of sight, and doing some
      further research into some advanced focus techniques.

      <h3>"Git er' done"</h3>
      <h4>10/20/2017</h4>
      <p>I recently completed the 3 assessments for ‘Version Control
      Using Git.” This was definitely a learning experience,
      because prior to this class I had virtually no experience with
      the terminal, git, or gitHub. First things first, I set the stage
      by clearing my Desktop of any distractions/things not relevant to
      the task at hand. So, in this case, the only applications I had
      open were Chrome (to view the assignment and use gitHub) and the
      terminal (see attached screenshot). Once I was fully immersed in
      the actual drills, it was all pretty much “play” from this point
      on. Beyond the first few self-explanatory steps of navigating to
      the correct folder to start, I was in uncharted territory. I basically
      had to experiment with different commands and combinations of commands
      to achieve the desired task. Though it was uncomfortable, I went from
      having essentially no knowledge of how to use Git, to achieving a baseline
      proficiency. Doing the steps of cloning, pulling, initializing, adding, and
      committing over and over again helped me develop an understanding of the
      procedural fundamentals of the version control software. I couldn’t help
      equating it to learning to drive a car with no idea of how cars worked.
      In other words, having to be told things like “Before you start the car,
      get into the driver’s seat. Before you put it in gear, start the engine.”
      These concepts are painfully obvious to anyone with a driver’s license,
      but still need to be learned at some point. That’s how I felt learning git;
      like a complete beginner, but that soon it would become second nature.
      Realistically, setting the stage is a great way to start off without any distractions,
      and it definitely helped in the beginning. However, since I’m working on a computer,
      distractions are still just a click away. Going forward, I think I could build
      on “setting the stage” by using my chrome settings to block distracting websites
      for a set time, putting my phone on silent and putting it out of sight, and doing
      some further research into some advanced focus techniques.

      <h3>"Navigating the Terminal"</h3>
      <h4>10/18/2018</h4>
      <p class="text-content">Last week I learned how to use the terminal during
      the “manage file systems” drills. First, I set the
      stage by organizing only the terminal and the gitHub
      instructions open. After the stage was set, I began
      going through the steps of the drills, which would be
      considered the “play” of this exercise. For someone that
       had never used the terminal before, I was surprised by
       how abrasive of an environment it was at first. It seemed
       like trying to find books on a bookshelf in a dark room with
       no lights. However, after the initial shell-shock, you I
       realized the terminal is just a faster and more effective
       way of accessing files (as opposed to clicking through
       windows in the Finder). Like all things related to programing,
       once you learn the basic language required to navigate at a
       basic level, things get a lot less scary, and you begin to
       realize how beneficial the new concepts are to your programming journey.
       Realistically, setting the stage is a great way to start off without
       any distractions, and it definitely helped in the beginning. However,
       since I’m working on a computer, distractions are still just a click away.
       Going forward, I think I could build on “setting the stage” by using my chrome
       settings to block distracting websites for a set time, putting my phone
       on silent and putting it out of sight, and doing some further research
       into some advanced focus techniques.
