      <h3>"Bob the Builder v3"</h3>
      <h4>10/28/2017</h4>
      <p>Today, my goals are to complete and submit the Version 3 drill for
      "Build Basic Websites," and to advance my CSS skills in the process.
      I've specified version 3, it's measurable in a binary sense in that I
      will either submit it or I will not, and it's achievable considering I
      got about half way done yesterday over the course of the whole day.
      It's relevant because this is the next assignment in the sylabus I need
      to copmlete, and the time frame of Monday, October 30th between 10am
      and 4pm is very cleary defined. As far as getting better at CSS goes,
      I will measure it by listing any new techniques I learn during Version 3.

      <h4>UPDATE/REFLECTION</h4>

        <p>I have accomplished my goals! I'm particularly proud of this because I really
        struggled with this final drill and I'm thrilled to have finally completed
        it to my own level of personal satisfaction, and using a few new CSS practices
        as well. What went well was that I learned some valuable lessons during
        version 2 that served me well this time around. First and foremost was taking
        advantage of the help available from my peers. Instead of spending hours
        aimlessly frustrated with CSS, trying desperately to get some element to
        move half an inch to the right, I would ask one of my classmates for
        assistance whenever I spent more than 10 minutes stuck on an issue. This
        greatly reduced my non-productive time and helped me maintain momentum
        throughout the day. It also helped mitigate my emotional frustration quite
        a bit. Also, I knew a lot more CSS techniques from version 2 that I had at
        my disposal to help power through version 3 more effectively. I was also less
        prone to distractions because I effectively set the stage by clearing my
        computer desktop of non-relevant windows and putting my phone away. Finally,
        I used the "rotate" method in CSS to change the orientation of some content.
        This is a very usefull tool for making diagonal lines/shapes, and I'm happy
        to have added it to my CSS arsenal.What didn't go so well was that there are
        still a few "mysterious happenings" going on with my CSS that I don't quite
        understand. Things occasionally don't do what I expect them too, which causes
        some delays. However, when I isolate and investigate these paranormal
        phenomena, I ultimately gain a deeper understanding of CSS, which is overall
        a very positive thing.

      <h3>"Bob the Builder"</h3>
      <h4>10/26/2017</h4>
      <p>Today, my goal is to successfully complete and submit the drill for
        version 2 of the "build-basic-websites" unit. This is a very specific
        (clearly defined) goal that will be measured on a binary scale of whether
        I completed it or not. I think it's definitely achievable in one day,
        considering the fact that version 1 took me most of yesterday to complete.
        It's extremely relevant because this is what the class is currently working
        on in the context of the sylabus, and the time-frame of today is very
        clearly defined.
      </p>

      <h4>UPDATE/REFLECTION</h4>

      <p>I have accomplished my goal. In retrospect, I set a very effective goal because
      I worked on the version 2 drill all day and submitted it right at the end of the
      day before stand down. This tells me that my SMART parameters were spot on.
      What went well is that I ultimately finished the version 2 drill.
      What didn't go so well was the seemingly endless time I spent getting
      frustrated with CSS. So far, HTML seems relatively intuitive and
      self-explanatory. It's basically just outlining the content of the page.
      CSS on the other hand is a maze of specificity that makes me sad all day.
      Prior to this week, CSS just seemed like this novel tool to make things
      change color or have borders, etc. Now I'm realizing that CSS is almost
      entirely responsible for the layout of a page (as well as all teh colors,
      borders, margins, etc). I'm having a very difficult time targeting what I
      want to target within CSS, although I do think I'm finally startign to grasp
      the concept of parents and children as it pertains to the
      flexbox. I will keep practicing though.
      </p>
      <h3>"L2L"</h3>
      <h4>10/24/2017</h4>
      <p>Today, my goal is to successfully complete and submit all of the "Learn
        to Learn" drills. This goal specifies a measurable amount of work that
        is relevant to the sylabus and able to be completed in the time I'm alloting
        for it.</p>

        <h4>UPDATE/REFLECTION</h4>

        <p>I have accomplished my goal, and it didn't even take all day. The actual
        writing process for the blog entries went very well, because not only do
        I enjoy writing, it also comes naturally to me. It also felt good to
        reflect on the things I've learned thus far at Galvanize.
        What didn't go so well was having to re-learn how to use wordpress. This wasn't
        really a "failure," it just wasn't as intuitive as the actual writing process.
        Tomorrow I will improve my smart goal process by giving myself a smaller time
        frame to achieve goals of a similar scope. This way I can manage my whole day
        more effectively.
